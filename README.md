# home_practice_helper
#home practice helper, is a fun little bot called Mitra (friend) 
Mitra helps yoga students practicing at home with ideas and poses to get the practice started!
Serious students will know what to do with the given suggestions and can build their practice on those.
If Mitra is not able to help she kindly asks the student to attend a yoga class and ask a live teacher.

This auto bot uses lists and if/elif/else statements as well as a while true loop
and asks for a simple string as an input.
